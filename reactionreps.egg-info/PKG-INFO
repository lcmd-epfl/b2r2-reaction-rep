# B2R2 Reaction Representation

This repo accompanies the paper "Physics-based representations for machine learning of chemical reactions".

This repository provides the means to:
- Generate the B2R2 reaction representations (in `src/reaction_reps`)
- Generate reaction representations from molecular representations (SLATM, FCHL, etci.)
- Access 4 reaction datasets (SN2-20, GDB7-20-TS, Proparg-21-TS and Hydroform-22-TS)
- For the latter (Hydroform-22-TS), this is the only place to find the dataset at the moment

An example generating learning curves for all reaction reps for the SN2 dataset is provided in `paper_sn2_example.ipynb`. 


# How to install
A `requirements.txt` file is provided which includes all required packages to run all examples.
These can be installed using `pip install requirements.txt`

# Citation
If using the B2R2 reaction representation, consider citing the paper with the bibtex provided:
